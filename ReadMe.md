Real-Time Audit Logging System in SQL Server

Implementing a real-time audit logging system in SQL Server involves capturing changes made to critical tables, such as Employees and Salaries, and recording these changes in an AuditLogs table. This can be achieved using triggers that respond to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating such a system.

1. Create the AuditLogs Table

First, define the AuditLogs table to store the audit information. This table should include columns to capture relevant details about the changes, such as the operation performed, the user who made the change, and timestamps.

•	AuditID: Unique identifier for each audit record.

•	TableName: Name of the table where the change occurred.

•	Operation: Type of operation (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE).

•	KeyValue: Primary key value(s) of the affected row.

•	OldData: JSON representation of the row data before the change.

•	NewData: JSON representation of the row data after the change.

•	ChangedBy: Username of the person who made the change.

•	ChangedOn: Timestamp of when the change occurred.


2. Create Triggers for the Employees Table

Next, create triggers on the Employees table to log INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

a. INSERT Trigger

b. UPDATE Trigger

c. DELETE Trigger


4. Create Triggers for the Salaries Table

Similarly, create triggers for the Salaries table.

a. INSERT Trigger

b. UPDATE Trigger

c. DELETE Trigger


5. Considerations

•	Performance: Implementing triggers can introduce overhead, especially on tables with high transaction volumes. It's essential to test the performance impact in a development environment before deploying to production.

•	Security: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the AuditLogs table to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.

•	Scalability: For large-scale applications, consider using SQL Server's built-in auditing features or third-party tools designed for auditing to handle more extensive auditing requirements efficiently.
